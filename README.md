# Bopler GUI

A gui and web interface to change patches on Roland JV-1010 synth engines across channels.

This allows for use with MPE controllers like the Linnstrument and Seaboard.

This wouldn't have been possible without the work of Geert Bevin (sendmidi, receivemidi, showmidi) and Roger Linn himself.
